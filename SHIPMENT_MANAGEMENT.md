  destinationWarehouse: "warehouse_id_2",
  transportId: "transport_id_1",
  items: [
    {
      productId: "product_id_1",
      quantity: 10,
      unitPrice: 25.00,
      condition: "excellent"
    }
  ],
  scheduledPickupDate: new Date(),
  estimatedDeliveryDate: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  priority: "high",
  temperatureRequired: true,
  minTemperature: 2,
  maxTemperature: 8
}

await createShipment(shipmentData, "/dashboard/transport/shipment-management")
```

### Updating Location
```typescript
await updateShipmentLocation(shipmentId, {
  latitude: 40.7128,
  longitude: -74.0060,
  address: "New York, NY",
  notes: "Stopped for fuel"
})
```

### Performing Quality Check
```typescript
await performQualityCheck(shipmentId, {
  results: "All items in excellent condition",
  issues: ["Minor packaging damage on item 3"],
  approved: true
})
```

## Notification Types

### Alert Categories
1. **Urgent**: Temperature alerts, damaged shipments, overdue deliveries
2. **High**: Delayed shipments, approaching deliveries
3. **Medium**: Quality checks required, successful deliveries
